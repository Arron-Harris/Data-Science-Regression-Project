# Data-Science-Regression-Project
#The aim of this project is to apply several regression algorithms on the dataset and measuring the success of the models by using related performance metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and R-Squared (R2 Score). In the study, charges of the sample are aimed to predict in terms of using features like age, sex and bmi of the person. The dataset can be found in the following Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance
